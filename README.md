Traffic Sign Classification Project

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier designed to identify various traffic signs with high accuracy. The model was developed using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), a comprehensive dataset featuring images from real-world road conditions in Germany.

Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide a reliable traffic sign recognition solution for autonomous driving systems or driver assistance technologies. The model classifies traffic signs captured under different lighting, angles, and environmental conditions, enabling vehicles to accurately interpret their surroundings.

Technical Details:

The following technologies and methods were used in the development of this project:

Dataset: The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which consists of thousands of images belonging to 43 distinct traffic sign classes.

Technologies Used: The PyTorch library was used for building and training the model. Pillow and OpenCV libraries were utilized for image processing and preprocessing steps.

Model Architecture:

A custom Convolutional Neural Network (Custom CNN) architecture was designed for this project. This architecture consists of multiple sequential convolutional (Conv2d) and pooling (MaxPool2d) layers to extract meaningful features from the images.

Batch normalization (BatchNorm2d) was applied after each convolutional layer to improve model performance and accelerate training.

Data Preprocessing: Images were resized to a standard dimension (64x64) and normalized to make them suitable for model training.

Training and Results:

The model was trained for 20 epochs using the Adam optimization algorithm and the Cross-Entropy Loss function.

Training Loss: As training progressed, the loss value decreased steadily, indicating that the model was effectively learning from the data. The final loss value in the last epoch reached an extremely low level of 2.73x10⁻⁶, which demonstrates the model's excellent fit to the training data.

Accuracy: The trained model achieved an impressive 96.22% accuracy on the test dataset. This result proves that the model can successfully classify new, unseen traffic signs.

Areas for Improvement:

While the project is a success, there are several areas that could be enhanced to further boost performance:

Data Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques, such as random rotations, zooming, and brightness adjustments, could be applied to the training data to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

Dropout Layers: Dropout layers could be added to the fully connected layers to prevent overfitting. This ensures more stable performance, especially when working with larger datasets.

Exploring Different Architectures: Transfer learning approaches using more complex and deeper architectures (e.g., pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG) could be explored.
